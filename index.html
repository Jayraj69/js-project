          <b>Gold Roger was known as the Pirate King, the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand
        Line.
        The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last
        words
        before his death revealed the location of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this
        revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece <i>(which
          promises
          an unlimited amount of riches and fame)</i>, and quite possibly the most coveted of titles for the
        person who
        found it, the title of the Pirate King.<b>

            </b>
            <b>Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club, high schooler Yuuji Itadori spends his days at either the clubroom or the hospital, where he visits his bedridden grandfather. However, this leisurely lifestyle soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a cursed item. Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice and negativity—after swallowing the said item, revealed to be a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the "King of Curses." <br>Yuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses pose to society as he discovers his own newfound powers. Introduced to the Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, he begins to walk down a path from which he cannot return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer.
